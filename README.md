# Project to integrate the results of metadata from a survey with microbial sequencing results in patients
### Firstly the metadata from a survey is integrated with the microbial abundance data from patient samples post DNA sequencing based on patient ID

### Following the integration, certain aspects of metadata may be filtered out depending on the data required to determine relationships. Additional exporting of a .csv file containing the integrated data is available.

### Additional aspects of plot designing to determine specific relationships between metadata and certain microbial community representation is underway, including a graph to display metadata and microbial abundance hand in hand.
